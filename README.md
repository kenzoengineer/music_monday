# Music Monday!

Every Monday a new judge is chosen and a new set of songs are submitted. Only one can take the crown of Music Prince. 

## Website

Check out https://musicmonday.kenjiang.ca/ to see some stats, view previous submissions, and see next week's judge.

## Discord Bot

The discord bot handles submissions and judging. Judging is a blind process, where the judge does not know who submitted which song (although it's usually fairly obvious). 

Automatic updates are not supported yet, so winners and submissions must be added to `winners.csv` manually.
